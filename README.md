I created a simple web-based task reminder system that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. 
Tasks can be added with a title, due time, and priority. The system also includes features to sort tasks by priority,
filter tasks due within a specific timeframe, and simulate reminders for tasks.

Features:

Add new tasks with title, due time (in minutes), and priority (High, Medium, Low).
Sort tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low).
Filter tasks that are due within the next 10 minutes.
Simulate reminders for upcoming tasks.

Technologies Used:
I used simple HTML,CSS and JS.
